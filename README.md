# Problem Description
- Mr. Nicholas Mendez contracted Spartan Tech Solutions to develop a Classroom Engagement Application for the logging of student engagement during online learning sessions. Due to the covid-19 pandemic, the constraints of engaging with students as well as the feedback margin are two primary scopes that have evolved dramatically. The proposed application to be developed is a Classroom Engagement Application that would run in parallel with a video conferencing application (e.g. Zoom, Blackboard Collaborate) that has existing chat capabilities to allow students to be more engaged in online learning. ​

# Major Features​

1. Share Impression ​
   - Allows a student to share their impression (feeling) at any point during a live session.​

2. View Analytics ​
   - Allows a host to view the analytical data (inclusive of student engagement data) of every session that they've hosted.​

3. Manage Question Bank​
   - Allows a host/teacher to manage(create and append) questions within the application's question bank.​
